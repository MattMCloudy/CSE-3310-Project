From SuperChatDataPublisher.cpp

1) domain? somebody explain domain like i'm 5. 
	  // create domain participant
  mgr.createParticipant("SuperChat!!!!!");

  is this something that has to be done just once at the beginning? like you set it up and the entire thing just runs on this one domain, right? 

2) //I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT "TYPE" IS EVEN THOUGH I READ IT IN THE TUTORIAL DOCUMENT.*********************************************************

  //create type
  MsgTypeSupport_var mt = new MsgTypeSupport();
  mgr.registerType(mt.in());

3) Topic? elaborate. 

4) isn't there a idl file that we're all supposed to use somewhere? i can't find where it's posted.
