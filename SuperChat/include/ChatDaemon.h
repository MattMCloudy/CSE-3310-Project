/*Matt:
 * OK finally we've found where the magic happens,
 * A daemon is a program that runs constantly underneath other user-level
 * programs, and I think it helps to think of this class in that way.
 * This will handle literally everything concerning the actual logic
 * of the program. Adding Chatrooms, Sending Messages, Adding Users, all of
 * these actions will have their origins in this class. However I'm not entirely sure
 * how all of that is going to work in reality. There is another class, ViewController
 * that we could enlist to be the middle man between this and UserInterface, but I think
 * we could also have the threads interweave between each other. For instance, while in
 * UserInterface the local user sends a message, then we could call a mutex lock there then
 * ui will make a method call to ChatDaemon to send that message. It sounds
 * a little hacky, but I think it might work. I'd love to know your thoughts.
 * So yeah, go crazy. Add methods here willy nilly and implement them in ChatDaemon.cpp.
 * As we build this thing up it will become more and more clear how we should design the
 * lower-level classes like Chatroom, User, and Message even though a lot of those decisions
 * have already been made for us.
 * GO TO ChatDaemon.cpp
