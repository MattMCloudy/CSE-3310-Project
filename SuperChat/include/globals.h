/* (megan) hey guys. i changed the globals a little. 
			I'm working on getting the online users list 
			to display in the online users box. It was 
			displaying them under offline users. After looking
			at the code, it looked like we needed a box for online
			and another for offline users so thats what i did. 
			hopefully i didn't mess anything up. 
			kthx.
