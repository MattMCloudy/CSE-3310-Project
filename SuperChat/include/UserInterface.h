/*Matt:
 * Welcome to the home of the entire UserInterface for SuperChat.
 * Here is where will produce the ncurses gui, listen for user input, and
 * make requests to ChatDaemon as necessary for sending messages, adding users,
 * adding chatrooms, exiting the program, and anything else we can dream up.
 * Be careful to use mutex locks whenever you make any calls to ChatDaemon, as
 * it is highly probable it will break if we don't. Other than that, go wild.
 * Feel free to add any methods necessary to make it beautiful. Right now, I just
 * have the code for the hello world example inside of create.
 * GO TO UserInterface.cpp
 * or if you haven't already GO TO ChatDaemon.h
