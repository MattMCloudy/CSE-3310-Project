/*Matt:
 *Alright, now we're in Initializer.cpp, here you can see the constructor
 *for Initializer which for right now, just instances two objects of ChatDaemon
 *and UserInterface. Then, it passes those two objects into the private variables
 *daemon and ui (which can be found in Initialzer.h).
 *After that we have our threading, mind you right now I haven't implemented
 *any kind of mutex so it will hit race conditions when they try
 *to enter the same critical region (printing, calls to the other class
 *will cause this). However, the mutex library is included already
 *so feel free to start including them. They are different however,
 *from the pthread mutexes (way easier honestly) so hit up tutorials point
 *or whatever before you go crazy. Another note, threading and mutexing in
 *c++ were implemented this way in c++11 the Makefile I have in the root
 *directory already includes this and the flags for the threading, just
 *be aware that it may get pissed off at you if you try to use some old compiler
 *in an IDE.
 *
 *Megan GO TO ../include/ChatDaemon.h
 *Nima  GO TO ../include/UserInterface.h
